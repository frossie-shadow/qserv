/// Memory allocation notes:
/// In the XrdSsi API, raw pointers are passed around for XrdSsiRequest objects,
/// and care needs to be taken to avoid deleting the request objects before
/// Finished() is called. Typically, an XrdSsiRequest subclass is allocated with
/// operator new, and passed into XrdSsi. At certain points in the transaction,
/// XrdSsi will call methods in the request object or hand back the request
/// object pointer. XrdSsi ceases interest in the object once the
/// XrdSsiRequest::Finished() completes. Generally, this would mean the
/// QueryRequest should clean itself up after calling Finished(). This requires
/// special care, because there is a cancellation function in the wild that may
/// call into QueryRequest after Finished() has been called. The cancellation
/// code is
/// designed to allow the client requester (elsewhere in qserv) to request
/// cancellation without knowledge of XrdSsi, so the QueryRequest registers a
/// cancellation function with its client that maintains a pointer to the
/// QueryRequest. After Finished(), the cancellation function must be prevented
/// from accessing the QueryRequest instance.
